Persistent volumes essentially removes the need to configure a storage solution like a volume for every user in the clutster. A persistent volume is confgured once and users creating pods and deployment can make a claim to it. A persistent volume claim is essentially a claim to a persistent volume :) Th pod can then be configured to use the persistent volume claim as volume  bad analogy but yeah. Btw both object can only be created delaratively, so dont try creating them impertavely.storage class are a way dynamically provision persistent volumes. When a claim is made to a volume, the storgae clas creates the peristent volume under the hood on the fly.
