A good way to think of ingress controllers is to think of them as eessentialy a layer 7 proxy baked into k8s. Ingress controllers are deployed via a deployment, configuration is placed in a config map and a service account with the right authorization is created too. A service to expose the deployment on stnadard port 80 and 443 is also created. Afterwrds, the ingress resources that specifies the rule on how traffic is directed to the cluster is also created. This together forms a simple ingress deployment. 

N/B: The port on the ingress rule actually points to service port not the ingress controller port
